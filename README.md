## üìñ About the Project
This project aims to recommend personalized movies to users based on their past ratings and movie content features like genre, cast, and keywords. The recommendation engine is built using **machine learning techniques** such as **cosine similarity** for content-based filtering and **matrix factorization** for collaborative filtering.

### Problem Statement:
With thousands of movies available, it's difficult for users to choose the next movie. This recommendation system addresses this challenge by suggesting movies the user is likely to enjoy.
